In this Capstone project, I created a strategy for a fictional digital search engine and content provider, GoYaFace, Inc. (often abbreviated as “GYF”). The strategy is used in responding to the increasing popularity and availability of “adblocking” software, which could have significant negative repercussions for GYF’s business. As a role of the leader of the Digital Advertising Tactics and Action (“DATA”) Team at GYF, which has been assigned the job of formulating GYF’s strategy in responding to the threat of adblocking.
